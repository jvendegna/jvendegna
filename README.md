- ❓ Get at me, ask personal questions. I'll add the answer here.

## Mantra: Accountability

Don't do things you can't accept the consequences for. I'm the first to admit when I'm wrong, I try to learn from my mistakes and at the end of the day, laugh them off.

## Best Feature: Ability to learn at a rapid pace

Bless the folks who maintain accurate documentation, I wouldn't be here without them.

## Biggest Shortcoming: I have been known speak my mind without filter, but I'm working on it.

Leaders listen first and speak last. I've read several books on the subject: Critical Conversations, Radical Candor, HTWF&IP and am employing these practices daily to help foster better relationships both in my personal and professional life.

## Best Animal: 🦨

Somebody has to like them. I had a neighbor with a pet skunk (stink glands removed) and it was the softest cuddliest little critter ever. For real. I love skunks.

## Favorite song

To hard, I love music. Here are some of my recent favorites.

✊🏿 📣 All of [Kendrick Lamar](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2YZyLoL8N0Wb9xBt1NhZWg?si=YYSwF5VWQCmbbMMONZX_Lg&dl_branch=1). Every single track without exception.

👁️ [Pusha T - If You Know You Know](https://open.spotify.com/track/6bGwKHXHNLmTy6yt147FPh?si=86d35a6ed43543d8) 👁️ - That's the reason we ball for, circle round twice for the encore.

🚁 [Dave - Clash](https://open.spotify.com/track/2zxEc1GCSCxbHIXTfhraRC?si=6fa9238abe1e4b07) - Jordan 4's or Jordan 1's ... Torrey putting in Labor, This that Jeremy Corbyn One. This that Viola Davis one. You gonna hate this one.

🕺 [Anderson.Paak - 6 Summers](https://open.spotify.com/track/0lG7iyNSstVOLV6faMIHdD?si=6700e8bf8fe14a11) - Aint shit gonna change for at least 6 summers

👼🏾 [SZA - Good Days](https://open.spotify.com/track/3YJJjQPAbDT7mGpX3WtQ9A?si=f4ae7d2630884759) 🗰 - Gotta get right, tryina free my mind before the end of the world. Still wanna believe in good days.

Not rap/hip-hop/grime:

📼 [Oneohtrix Point Never - Long Road Home](https://open.spotify.com/track/31Ocb5xOyTkjIyv7FdBF05?si=9e19d5a652374b1b) - We just deny that the truth is untold - No one to rally us both

🎙️ [070 Shake - Morrow](https://open.spotify.com/track/3sIoWQZbJqUKj5iELz8eTA?si=b745b3c88bdb413e) - I know, it's hard to swallow. I don't know if I'll be here tomorrow.

🧚 [Spellling - Magic Act](https://open.spotify.com/track/4BFpYx1z30gmkcZhkNfCCo?si=815f17ddadc24ac3) - It's like a supergroup of all the influences from my childhood. Like if a Disney princess wanted to rock your face off.

## Favorite Historical Figure

This one is odd. [Cotton Mather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Mather). The guy at the helm of the Salem Witch Trials, was also a Harvard medical school graduate at the age of 14 where he studies virology - study of viruses. Wrote as much if not more than Alexander Hamilton - 450 published books. 
In a failure to follow the implications of his actions and accept accountability for his role in the witch trials (see what I did there :P), 18 years later smallpox was ravaging Boston. Mather was a vocal 
advocate for innoculation. But people did not trust him, as they thought he was still trying to kill them off for being impius. So they killed him instead, and in turn he inadvertently
quite literally created the anti-vaccination movement! History is so insane you can't make this stuff up!
